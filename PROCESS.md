# Day 1 (4-6)
Made my proposal and sended it in for grading.

# Day 2 (5-6)
My proposal has been turned down, so I made a new one and started the DESIGN.md file.

# Day 3 (6-6)
Finished my DESIGN.md and thought about ways to make my project bigger if I would have time left over.

# Day 4 (7-6)
Started by trying to make a HTTP server on my computer again to show me my data projects and I started to make a map in it.

# Day 5 (8-6)
We had the presentations and I learned a lot off new things like BS grid and colorbrewer so I looked at those and worked on my map again.

# Day 6 (11-6)

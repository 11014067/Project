# Day 1 (4-6)
Made my proposal and sended it in for grading.

# Day 2 (5-6)
My proposal has been turned down, so I made a new one and started the DESIGN.md file.

# Day 3 (6-6)
Finished my DESIGN.md and thought about ways to make my project bigger if I would have time left over and smaller if I had to little time.

# Day 4 (7-6)
Started by trying to make a HTTP server on my computer again to show me my data projects and I started to make a map in it.
But trying to get a HTTP server took a lot of time.

# Day 5 (8-6)
We had the presentations and I learned a lot off new things like BS grid and colorbrewer so I looked at those and worked on my map again.

# Day 6 (11-6)
I made a state map, but the state names would not link to the states. Looking for ways to identify the state paths.

# Day 7 (12-6)
Finaly found a way to link the names to the states via id numbers, working on the barchart and starting the calendar.

# Day 8 (13-6)
The states are coloured for population in 2015 and calendar is not coloured.

# Day 9 (14-6)
The states can be coloured for population and Income in different years inside JS and the calander is coloured for Texas.

# Day 10 (15-6)
The colouration looked weird and I found there to be a bug, been trying to fix it but the problem keeps shifting to new bugs.

# Day 11 (18-6)
The colouration bug finaly fixed for the map, now working on a update function for the colouration if another option or years are chosen.

# Day 12 (19-6)
Making the final touches on the update functions for the map and working on bootstrap grid.

# Day 13 (20-6)
Made an update function for the bargraph where he deletes the old one and makes a new one, because updating did not want to work.

# Day 14 (21-6)
Adding all of the weather data and making the last update function for the weather.

# Day 15 (22-6)
Giving the states and calendar a title as mayby temporary tooltip. Bootstrap grid finaly fixed fully.

# Day 16 (25-6)
Tooltip made and titles deleted again and working on the bargraph.

# Day 17 (26-6)
Made the bargraph with oridinal y axis in stead of liniear which finaly gave it labels. Working on code efficientcy.

# Day 18 (27-6)
Making buttons for storytelling and help and starting the map tooltip before hovering over the map first.

# Day 19 (28-6)
Making all the .md files and cleaning up code with the style guide.
I tried multiple times in the last week to add legends, so decided to add my old ones from data but they didnt show up eventhough they where in my html when I inspected.
So I decided to decided to delete it again.

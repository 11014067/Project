## Data sources:
* Amount of McDonald locations per citizen for each state:
https://247wallst.com/consumer-products/2016/09/04/the-number-of-mcdonalds-in-all-50-states/

* Amount of wallgreens
https://news.walgreens.com/fact-sheets/store-count-by-state.htm

* Amount of Target
https://www.scrapehero.com/target-com-analysis-of-store-locations-across-the-u-s/ 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population 

* Amount of wallmark
https://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/locations/united-states#/united-states 

* Weather: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#datasets
Or https://www.usclimatedata.com/ 

## External components:
I think all this can be done with basic d3 and if necessary some help from d3-tip.

## Similar visualizations:
* Weather calander: http://bl.ocks.org/KathyZ/c2d4694c953419e0509b
* Usa map:  https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2206590 
* Scatterplot: my week 6 project  https://github.com/11014067/homework/tree/master/Homework/week_6

## Dificulties:
The calander is going to be hard because I have to test how the data loads and how I can make it in to the calander. If a calander really seams to be unmakeable I can make it a simple line or bar chart with average temperature each month and a dataset that only shows monthly averages.

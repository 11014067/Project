# Project design
## Data
The data for the map and bar graph can be copy pasted from the sites (sources in PROPOSAL.md and on the site). This is already done and the files can be found in the data folder.
The site with the weather data has explanations on how to get to the data in your code.
## Components
The project has a map from the USA, a slider from 2011 till 2015, a dropdown with options for variable to show on the map, a temperature calendar and a bar graph with some cost information. There are basic explanations on these components online. There might be some d3-tip to make infomation boxes and link the different visualisations.

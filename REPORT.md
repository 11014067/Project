My visualisation shows a map of the US, a calendar and a barchart to show information about population, GDP, income, weather and cost of living.

To make all these visualisations there are different funcitons: loading and checking data, making the visualisation, updating visualisations and information buttons.
So firstly the data is loaded after which there is a function to check and manipulate the data to make it work the best way posible.
Secondly there are functions to make the map, calendar and barchart each including there own tooltip. 
Then come the update functions, starting with the map for if you choose to see a different year or dataset. 
The next update function is for if you click on one of the states, which will change the site's title to that state, start to remake the barchart and it will start to call the update functions for the calendar.
The calendar update function follows.
Lastly there are two functions to show or hide the story or help information.

The chalanges started the first day for me, because I last programmed 5 months ago just starting up my old data projects took some time.
After some time I was able to start a server again and succesfully work with notepad++. This was hard because nobody did it like I used to and it was hard for me to understand their ways and programms.
Also the calendar was something I never made before, this was a great chalange because the standard d3 calendar is for multiple years.
Colouring the each of the squares and getting the data in a well usable format was a struggle. 
Also the barchart would not update, this eventually was fixed by just making a new one, because the barchart doesn't take much computerpower to make.
Working with bootstrap grid also was a huge challenge for me, most infomation on the internet helps you make the rows and collumns but none help you with wat to load.
This gave me the impression I did not need to load anything, after some help from Tim I finally found the files and it worked.

In a world with a lot of time I would have most defenitly wanted to add natural disaster data to for instance the map or another visualisation.
If you are going to choose where to live you want to be save, I think natural disasters would have been the right way to show. 
Maybe adding crime rates or something simular as well. But I am happy with the visualisation I have now. 
It took me a lot of work to get these visualisations done and I loved to be able to program again. 
Though it was hard to start up again, I made the best of what I knew and the time I had. 
My proposal the population, GDP and income data where originally choosable with checkboxes but a dropdown made it easier to see that you can only choose one.
The dropdown also looks nice next to the slider because the slider only works for 5 years so otherwise the slider would have been really long or akwardly alone.
By having the dropdown and the slider next to each other the hole row is a row to change the visualisation.
Which I really like and think looks a lot better than only having the slider or having the slider next to 3 checkboxes.
